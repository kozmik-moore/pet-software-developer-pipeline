    "HappyPaws has collected three datasets over the past year: \n",
    " - \"pet_activities.csv\" which logs daily activities of pets, \n",
    " - \"pet_health.csv\" which records vet visits and health issues, and \n",
    " - \"users.csv\" which contains information about the pet owners. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each dataset contains unique identifiers for pets and/or their owners. \n",

    "\n",
    "They want to make things easier by having a single table with all data included.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your manager has asked you to write a Python function that cleans and merges these datasets into a single dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "The final dataset should provide a comprehensive view of each pet's activities, health records, and owner information. \n",
    "\n",

    "- Your `all_pet_data()` function must return a DataFrame, with columns as described below.\n",
